<h1>The Road Back to the College Football Field</h1>
<h3>What Amari Rodgers and Data Sets Can Teach Us About the Challenges Involved</h3>

<p>Have you ever heard of Amari Rodgers? He is a terrific athlete competing at a high level at Clemson University. Rodgers tore his ACL, which is one of the most detrimental injuries an athlete can experience. Not only is it extremely painful when you tear it but the recovery process is long – typically 10 months – and filled with physical pain and mental challenges. Rodgers worked incredibly hard at his rehabilitation and miraculously was jogging on the football field three short months after surgery. Over the next few weeks he was progressively getting faster and eventually sprinting a mere few weeks after just jogging. His father being the assistant coach for another big time program, University of Texas, knows how these recoveries go. So you could only imagine his surprise when Mr. Rogers and the Clemson head coach were texting about Amari’s speedy recovery and progress. A source fromESPN was able to get some of their conversation and as Mr. Rogers inquired from a, “Is he serious—he jogging?” Dabo Swinney, Clemson’s coach, replied. ‘Yeah, he’s progressing really fast!””. He was even making sharp cuts on the practice fields. Rodgers was stunned, proud, and maybe a bit worried things were moving too quickly.</p>

<p>We know that Amari Rodgers is the exception, not the rule. We also know that athletes put their bodies through tremendous stress and strain when competing at the collegiate level. According to Syracuse University Athletic Trainer, Brandon Hall and Assistant A.D. for Football Performance, Sean Edinger, from interviews I conducted, both said that the most common injury in college football is a sprained ankle, because of all the cutting, hesitations, and stop and go movement athletes have to do on a daily basis for hours on end. That stated, they also agreed that the most detrimental and the hardest injury to regain your full potential from is an ACL tear – what Amari Rodgers had – and what makes his story so remarkable. Finally, they added that the two most injury prone positions are running backs and wide receivers, which makes perfect sense if you understand all the cutting, starting, and stopping they needed to do to be effective in their role.</p>

<p>Once we discussed injuries I then asked them about the toll it takes on the athletes mentally. According to the trainers, this part of the recovery process is overlooked. Coming back from a traumatic injury is clearly very physically demanding, but also mentally – creating doubt and skepticism you can return to form and also the fear that such an injury creates and the possibility it could happen again. Hall and Edinger explained the dynamic further, “Athletes come back from these severe injuries by doing the same motions that they injured themselves with.”</p>

<p>Taking a step back more broadly, there is ample data to support the amazing recovery of Rodgers and to reinforce what Hall and Edinger are asserting.  They talked about the recovery process in which they take athletes through to get them back on the field. A study of college football player injuries entitled “Injury Rates in a National Sample of College Football Teams: A 2-Year Prospective Study” by Zemper analyzed 6,229 players from 1986 and 1987. Zemper found that the injury rate was 6.32/per thousand. Sprains of the knee, such as Rodgers mentioned above, and ankles were the most common. Interestingly, there is a 3.1% chance that an ACL tear will occur for a college football athlete. This is not a very significant figure compared to, for example, the most prevalent injury of a muscle or joint sprain, where athletes have a 31.5% chance of having that happen during their career. These are completely different injuries, yet they still often follow a similar recovery process where trainers ease athletes back into activity involving these muscles to build them back up again.</p>

<p>As someone who watches and studies sports I was surprised to not see concussions at the top of the injury list. Concussions bring college football so much attention and media coverage that it is curious that the findings were not more dramatic in this study. One explanation, given this study was done back in 1986 and 1987 is that researchers did not focus their attention on concussions back then the way they do today. Similarly, the Syracuse University athletic trainer and Men's Football strength and conditioning coach discussed muscle sprains as a core focus of their work – much more so than any other aspect.</p>

<p>In conclusion, injuries in college football are, as they say, part of the game. The ability to come back from such injuries is also what helps players have successful careers and, perhaps, go on to professional careers. There have been many advances in athletic training that help players get back on the field quickly and safely in most cases. While very few recover in the amazing way Amari Rodgers did, the data shows that injuries will occur, but techniques to help players recover will keep pace with these challenges. The data also suggests that more emphasis can be given to the most common injuries to help prevent them from occurring in the first place.</p>
